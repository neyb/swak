when undertow meets rxjava & kotlin

# status
in development

# what is swak
swak is a library which allow to start a http server where everthing is asynchronous.

## everything is code
in swak, everything is code : a nice syntax allow it to be easy to configurable
while being very flexible

# example

# tasks
* use `Internal` what can be
* around Wrapper
 * timeout
* list routes
* dont build interceptorPluger when not necessary
* separate undertow (to eventually let user replace it)

# where 'swak' comes from
well... we all know kotlin coders got the swak
